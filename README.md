# Non-Planar 3D Printer

In this project we use a paste extruder and a UR10 robot arm to experiment with non-planar 3D printing. The design of our mechanical paste extruder is based on [CERA-1 open source mechanical paste extruder](https://github.com/bryancera/CERA-1) project by [Brian Cera](https://www.bryancera.com/) with some modifications of our own to make it easier to exchange and clean material tubes. The design of auger system is based on [cheap de-airing extruder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4805607) by [Piotr Wasniowski](https://www.instagram.com/piotr_wasniowski/?hl=en) with our own modifications to make it work as a robot endeffector.
